#Function acronym()- Given users input, an acronym is formed form the first letters of all words in the unput that start with a capital letter.
#Parameters: N/A
#Input: A User string 
#Returns: A string with the acronym of the user's input

#Function processList() takes in a list of numbers and returns a sorted list with all non-negative distinct values
